    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 14, 2025</p>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> DoNotNotify</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Anuj Jain</p>
    <p><strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:aj@jainanuj.com">aj@jainanuj.com</a></p>
  </header>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      DoNotNotify (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. 
      This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our mobile application (“App”), 
      which helps users block unwanted notifications on Android devices. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We designed DoNotNotify with privacy in mind. The app operates entirely on your device — 
      no personal data is collected, transmitted, or stored externally.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      DoNotNotify does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any personally identifiable information. 
      Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or contact details.</li>
      <li>We do not track your behavior within the app or on your device.</li>
      <li>We do not send or store any notification data, messages, or app usage statistics.</li>
      <li>We do not use any remote servers or cloud storage — all data stays on your phone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Everything DoNotNotify does occurs locally on your device. 
      No information ever leaves your Android system environment.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Notification Access Permission</h2>
    <p>
      To function properly, DoNotNotify requires the <strong>Notification Access</strong> permission. 
      This permission allows the app to read and manage notifications for the purpose of blocking or filtering them 
      based on the rules you define.
    </p>
    <p>
      This access is used solely to detect incoming notifications and determine whether they match your filters. 
      DoNotNotify never stores or transmits these notifications anywhere outside your device. 
      Your notification data remains entirely private and local.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. How the App Works</h2>
    <p>
      When a new notification appears, DoNotNotify evaluates it according to your filter rules. 
      If the notification matches one of your rules, the app dismisses or suppresses it locally. 
      The app does not interfere with other parts of your system or access data from unrelated apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      All rules and preferences are stored securely in your device’s local storage 
      (within Android’s app sandbox) and are deleted automatically if you uninstall the app.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      DoNotNotify does not integrate with or rely on any third-party analytics, advertising, 
      or tracking services. The app operates independently and does not use any external APIs or SDKs 
      that might collect data about you or your device.
    </p>
    <p>
      If in the future we choose to integrate such services (for example, anonymous crash analytics), 
      we will update this Privacy Policy and provide clear in-app notice before enabling them.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Because DoNotNotify does not collect or transmit data, we do not retain any user information. 
      All app preferences, such as blocked app lists or text filters, are stored only on your device. 
      When you uninstall the app, all associated data is automatically deleted.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take your privacy seriously. DoNotNotify uses Android’s standard security mechanisms 
      to ensure that its data (local rules and preferences) are accessible only by the app itself. 
      We do not store any information externally or transmit it to any server, 
      eliminating the risks of interception or unauthorized access.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      DoNotNotify is designed for general audiences and does not target children. 
      We do not knowingly collect or solicit information from anyone under the age of 13 
      (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). 
      If you are a parent or guardian and believe that a child has provided us with personal information, 
      please contact us at <a href="mailto:aj@jainanuj.com">aj@jainanuj.com</a> 
      so we can delete it immediately.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app’s functionality 
      or in applicable laws and regulations. If significant changes occur, 
      we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page and, 
      where appropriate, provide notice within the app or on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed 
      about how we protect your information.
    </p>
  </section>
